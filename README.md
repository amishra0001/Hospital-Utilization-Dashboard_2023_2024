Hospital Utilization Dashboard (Power BI)

Overview

This Power BI project analyzes hospital utilization data from 2023â€“2024, focusing on patient activity, admissions, emergency room visits, and key operational metrics.
The dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of healthcare performance, helping analysts and hospital leaders identify trends, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.


What This Dashboard Shows

The dashboard allows users to explore:

Patient load and admissions over time

Hospitals with the highest bed occupancy rates

Trends in average length of stay (LOS)

Readmission rate patterns across hospitals and payer types

The breakdown of payer mix (Medicare, Medicaid, Private, Self-Pay)

Key Metrics

Metric	Description
Total Patients	Monthly patient volume
ER Visits	Number of emergency room visits
Admissions	Inpatient admissions
Discharges	Patients discharged
Average Length of Stay (LOS)	Average days per patient stay
Bed Occupancy Rate	% of hospital beds occupied
Readmission Rate	% of patients readmitted
Payer Type	Type of insurance coverage

 -- Total Patients
Total Patients = SUM(Hospital_Utilization[Total_Patients])

-- Total ER Visits
Total ER Visits = SUM(Hospital_Utilization[ER_Visits])

-- Total Admissions
Total Admissions = SUM(Hospital_Utilization[Inpatient_Admissions])

-- Total Discharges
Total Discharges = SUM(Hospital_Utilization[Discharges])

-- Average Length of Stay
Avg LOS = AVERAGE(Hospital_Utilization[Average_Length_of_Stay])

-- Average Bed Occupancy Rate
Avg Bed Occupancy = AVERAGE(Hospital_Utilization[Bed_Occupancy_Rate])

-- Average Readmission Rate
Avg Readmission Rate = AVERAGE(Hospital_Utilization[Readmission_Rate])

-- Patients by Payer Type (for charts)
Patients by Payer = SUM(Hospital_Utilization[Total_Patients])
